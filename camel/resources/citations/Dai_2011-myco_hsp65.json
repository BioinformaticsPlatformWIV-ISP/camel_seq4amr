  "abstract": "Mycobacteria include a large number of pathogens. Identification to species level is important for diagnoses and treatments. Here, we report the development of a Web-accessible database of the hsp65 locus sequences (http://msis.mycobacteria.info) from 149 out of 150 Mycobacterium species/subspecies. This database can serve as a reference for identifying Mycobacterium species."
